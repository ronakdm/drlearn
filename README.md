# drlearn

`drlearn`is a library for incorporating distributionally robust optimization seamlessly into estimators that use the `scikit-learn` interface.

## Installation

You can install `drlearn` by running the following on the command line from the
root folder:
```
pip install -e .
```
Additional dependencies to run the example in `examples/*.ipynb` can be installed using `pip install -e .[examples]`. To build the docs, additional dependencies can be run using `pip install -e .[docs]`.
