DRLearn
==============

DRLearn is a library for incorporating distributionally robust optimization seamlessly into estimators that use the ``scikit-learn`` interface. 
It implements the spectral risk measure-based learning techniques from this `this AISTATS 2023 paper <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/mehta23b.html>`_ and this `this ICLR 2024 paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13863>`_ (Spotlight Presentation). 
Distributionally robust objectives apply a sample reweighting to the observed training data within each mini-batch in order to robustify models against distribution shifts that occur at test time. 

This package parallels a similar one, which is built for machine learning workflows based on ``torch`` (as opposed to ``scikit-learn``), called:

Installation
------------------

You can install DRLearn by running

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:ronakdm/drlearn.git
    $ cd drlearn
    $ pip install -e .

To build the docs, additional dependencies can be run using ``pip install -e .[docs]``.

Quickstart
------------------

First, we construct a distributionally robust objective that inputs a vector of losses and returns a weighted average of its entries that upweighs its larger values. 

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from drlearn import make_extremile_spectrum, Ridge
  >>> n = 100
  >>> X = np.random.normal(size=(n, 10))
  >>> y = np.random.normal(size=(n,))
  >>> 
  >>> spectrum = make_extremile_spectrum(n, 2.0)
  >>> weight_decay = 0.01 # l2 regularization parameter
  >>> model = Ridge(spectrum=spectrum, weight_decay=weight_decay).fit(X, y)

The variable ``model``` is now an estimator that has a ``predict`` method. The ``BinaryLogisticRegression`` and ``MultinomialLogisticRegression`` estimators also have ``predict_proba`` methods. 
Please refer to ``docs/quickstart.ipynb`` for a more detailed example.
